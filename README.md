# Burger-king-demo-page

Recreated Burger king page using MEAN stack.

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

Git - Download & Install Git. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed. JQuery, Angular, angular routers and bootstrap can be accessed using their CDN path.

To make the web pages responsive irrespective of the type of device or screen size, I have used bootstrap framework.

Outline:
1. Recreated burger king website which has a home page, menu, sign in and register page.
2. Created the front end using Angular Framework.
3. Install node and npm. Npm makes it easy to install all the dependencies
4. Routing to different pages using Angular routers.

Disclaimer: Tried to recreate the burger king page as it was impressive and wanted to check it out. This is purely for demo purpose.

Thanks!
